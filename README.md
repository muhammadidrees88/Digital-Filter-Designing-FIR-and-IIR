# Digital-Filter-Designing-FIR-and-IIR Using Frequency Analysis-
Digital signal processing-FIR(using windoowing method) and IIR(Butterworth Approximation) Filters
A very useful document for the students who are looking for designing the digital filters i.e. FIR and IIR
Moreover,a practical example has been done for better understanding using MATLAB.A complete running code with comments is attached with the files and plots as well.
